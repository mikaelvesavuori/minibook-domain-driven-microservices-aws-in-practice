# Implementation

This section describes key passages of the code and the overall implementation rather than rehashing the complete and rather extensive code base. The approach will be checking out and analyzing examples of patterns, especially for the tactical DDD concepts:

* Modules
* Services
* Repositories
* Factories
* Value objects
* Entities
* Aggregates
* Events
