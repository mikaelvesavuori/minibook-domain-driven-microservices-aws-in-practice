# How to progress

You made it this far, good for you! I'll take the opportunity to describe a number of things you can do to learn more.

If you are anything like me, or most people I suppose, then it's going to take more than one activity and one shot at a project to make it have all the bells and whistles. My proposal is to continue doing hands-on work based on what you've seen. It should be able to sustain you for some time. Then, as you have something of your own in your backpack, you can start to truly take in the full extent of DDD and what has been said and thought.

## Run the demo code locally

I wouldn't be surprised if you only read. Do take the time to actually run the code locally and muck about with it to see things change and evolve. You might be inexperienced with TypeScript or JavaScript, or any of the other many pieces that make it run, but there just is no way to better understand tactical DDD.

## Add support for multiple rooms, sites, time zones

asdf

## Build the application from scratch

TODO

## Build your own application

TODO

## Try out EventStorming with colleagues or friends

TODO

## Learn diagramming

TODO

## Write technical documentation

Either for an own project, something at work, an open source project, or whatever really.

## Push for a "ubiquitous language" in an existing project

TODO

## Read up on secondary-source literature

There's excellent and more condensed material available these days. It doesn't replace the original texts as much as it offers a more accessible path for many readers.

I recommend Vladik Khononov's [_Learning Domain-Driven Design: Aligning Software Architecture and Business Strategy_](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/57573212-learning-domain-driven-design) (O'Reilly, 2021). It's just easier than the blue and red books, and it's very good in its own right. Like this mini-book, it has to skip the deeper stuff, but that's precisely why I think you should start here.

You can get [_Domain Driven Design Quickly_](https://www.infoq.com/minibooks/domain-driven-design-quickly/) by Abel Avram and Floyd Marinescu for free, in the form of a PDF.

There's also a free PDF of [_Domain-Driven Design Reference: Definitions and Pattern Summaries_](https://www.domainlanguage.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DDD\_Reference\_2015-03.pdf) __ by Eric Evans for those reference-type needs you might have.

An stellar resource, especially if you are in the .NET world, is Microsoft's online book [_.NET Microservices Architecture for Containerized .NET Applications_](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/microservice-ddd-cqrs-patterns/). The link takes you to the (big) section dedicated to DDD.

## Go to the primary sources

This might feel really oddâ€”having these distinguished sources at the very back of list, like this. Almost sacrilege? No, I don't actually think so. The primary sources are very, very good in my opinion but they&#x20;
