# Doodling, drawing, whiteboarding flows and concepts

Early Preparation or even "pre-prep" on the concept stage is something I value a lot. It makes it easier to think and work and to ask relevant questions. I'm sure you might have been in many meetings where you are introduced to a new project and angles and questions that (later) feel totally natural didn't get a single thought in that meeting. That's why I like this, so you are "getting used" to the new work. Note that none of this has to do with DDD.

I think it's a really valid concept to do such spitballing on paper (if you are alone) or on a whiteboard (if you are with more people). At this stage it's more about getting your mind used to the business case, any terminology you might know (or need to know!), some flow charts to describe where you might be going, etc.

When it's in the early stages I find that sometimes I need to remind folks (sometimes even myself) that these really _are just_ drafts or rough sketches and not a full-fledged way of building something.

Personally I think this part is really funâ€”just don't let this part be a massive book end for the work you are doing but more like a creative exercise to start feeling the materials and substance of the work. As someone who knows DDD, I use this exercise as a way of also trying a first fit for various things I encounter in the project into the "tactical" concepts of DDD, such as entities and events. More on those later.

**Note**: As a part of my work with building this book and its coded implementation, this is the stage in which I really for the first time started to see what the division of services might be.
