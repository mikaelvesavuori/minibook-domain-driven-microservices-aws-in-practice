# Doodling, drawing, whiteboarding flows and concepts

I think it's still a really valid concept to have some first spitballing on paper (if you are alone) or on a whiteboard (if you are with more people). At this stage it's more about getting your mind used to the business case, any terminology you might know, some flow charts to describe where you are going, etc.

When it's in the early stages I find that sometimes I need to remind folks (sometimes even myself) that these really are drafts or rough sketches and not a full-fledged way of building something.

Personally I think this part is really fun. Just don't let this part be a massive book end for the work you are doing but more like a creative exercise to start feeling the materials and substance of the work.

**Note**: As a part of my work with building this book and it's coded implementation, this is the stage in which I really for the first time started to see what the division of services might be.
