# The domain(s)

TODO

[Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/) has a fine two-part introduction to DDD and their distillation of the various domain types is short and informative enough to quote wholesale:

> A **core domain** is what makes an organization special and different from other organizations. An organization cannot succeed (or even exist) without being exceptionally good in their core domain. Because the core domain is so important, it should receive the highest priority, the biggest effort and the best developers. For smaller domains you may only identify a single core domain, larger domains may have more than one. You should be prepared to implement the features of the core domain from scratch.
>
> A **supporting subdomain** is a subdomain that is necessary for the organization to succeed, but it does not fall into the core domain category. It is not generic either because it still requires some level of specialization for the organization in question. You may be able to start with an existing solution and tweak it or extend it to your specific needs.
>
> A **generic subdomain** is a subdomain that does not contain anything special to the organization but is still needed for the overall solution to work. You can save a lot of time and work by trying to use off-the-shelf software for your generic subdomains. A typical example would be user identity management.

We will see examples of concrete artifacts that can be co-created to describe the domain.
