# Structure

Much of DDD wisdom and attempts at concretely structuring files in a DDD-oriented sense will address whether to go with an approach based on "package by layer" or "package by feature".

Three things to note here:

1. Many examples are based on monolithic applications, something I personally very rarely work on. The example here addresses a microservice perspective. The bounded context itself is the main feature, so to speak.
2. Clean Architecture changes the structure and naming a bit. We will base our core understanding on CA and its nomenclature, as it's more intuitive and still packs the same punch as regular DDD.
3. TODO
