# The business flow

TODO

{% hint style="info" %}
You could certainly go full-bore with EventStorming and essentially encapsulate the business flows there.

An optional approach could be to do some (light-weight?) BPMN model, though I would perhaps rather lean back into the full EventStorming approach in that case so we aren't caught in unnecessary complexity spreading around the work.
