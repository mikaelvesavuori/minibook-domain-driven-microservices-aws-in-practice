# The logical business flow

{% hint style="info" %}
You could certainly go full-bore with EventStorming (introduced later) and essentially encapsulate the business flows there.

An optional approach could be to do some (light-weight?) BPMN model, though I would perhaps rather lean back into the full EventStorming approach in that case so we aren't caught in unnecessary complexity spreading around the work.
{% endhint %}

Already at the start, if possible, it's wise to have some visual and logical model to describe what's going on. This type of flowchart may in complex cases become unwieldy and cumbersome.

TODO&#x20;

The diagram as presented here has been modified several times to fit the logical model.
