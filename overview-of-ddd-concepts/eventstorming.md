# Eventstorming

[Eventstorming](https://www.eventstorming.com) is a workshop model invented by Alberto Brandolini in 2012 to help facilitate explorative work in the spirit of Domain Driven Design. It's a fast-paced way of coming to a shared understanding among the attendees (who should span the maximum gamut of stakeholders), helping to shape requirements as well as understand the business process.

The original format is very physical, using paper to cover a wall and making use of colored sticky notes and marker pens to, first, come to terms with the current notion of the project/work, and then to bit by bit consolidate that view into sequential orderings of the core concepts:

* Aggregates
* Commands
* Domain events
* Actors
* Policies (business process)
* Views (read models)
* External system

In the below picture you can see the end state of how I addressed this particular project. What is not quite apparent is of course the evolution of terms over time. In my first sketches and first rounds of work, for example the term `Reserve` was not used. Instead, it was `Book`. But you don't really book a room, right, rather you reserve it.

On the good side, this exercise greatly improved even a completely fictional product made by one person!

My take on this is not necessarily by the book, as we are also missing a key component: The sequential order of these.
