# Beginning DDD

TODO

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven\_design) starts with this definition,

> **Domain-driven design** (**DDD**) is a [software design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software\_design) approach focusing on modelling software to match a [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain\_\(software\_engineering\)) according to input from that domain's experts.
>
> In terms of [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented\_programming) it means that the structure and language of software code (class names, [class methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class\_method), [class variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class\_variable)) should match the [business domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business\_domain). For example, if a software processes loan applications, it might have classes like `LoanApplication` and `Customer`, and methods such as `AcceptOffer` and `Withdraw`.
>
> DDD connects the [implementation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation) to an evolving model.
>
> Domain-driven design is predicated on the following goals:
>
> * placing the project's primary focus on the core [domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain\_\(software\_engineering\)) and domain logic;
> * basing complex designs on a model of the domain;
> * initiating a creative collaboration between technical and [domain experts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain\_expert) to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems.

### The patterns of DDD
