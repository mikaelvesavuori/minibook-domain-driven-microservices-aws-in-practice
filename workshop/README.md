# Scenario

This example and workshop focuses on overall system design and the goal of setting up an event-driven architecture.

The format will be of a guided tour, meaning that I will write sequentially (post-fact) about the key parts involved in landing a solution I feel encompasses what this book is trying to tell.

In the interest of time and energy, certain features of a full solution are therefore excluded from the scope of this exercise. Also, we should spend less time on details like worrying for conflicting names of rooms, as that is not what we are focusing our cognitive effort on.
