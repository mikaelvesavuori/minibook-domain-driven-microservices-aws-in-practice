# What we will be building

This example and workshop focuses on overall system design and the goal of setting up an event-driven architecture.

The format will be of a guided tour, meaning that I will write sequentially (post-fact) about the key parts involved in landing a solution I feel encompasses what this book is trying to tell.

In the interest of time and energy, certain features of a full solution are therefore excluded from the scope of this exercise. Also, we should spend less time on details like worrying for conflicting names of rooms, as that is not what we are focusing our cognitive effort on.

Also, the code's "mono repo" structure is more for convenience than a "decision" as such.

## Structure

The root of the GitHub code repository will contain the following pertinent bits: (TODO)

* `code`: Source code
* `data-modeling`: JSON files to use when starting to model the data
* `diagrams`: Diagrams for the solution

## Data modeling

The `data-modeling` folder contains various forms of data which we can model and fill in for our use case.

We can skip any envelope level here and just focus on the original data contents instead.

For dynamic values, set the field similar to the format `"<Some description here>"`.

## Goals
