# Note about reality and learning

This is just a short disclaimer to be super-real about the fact that it is somewhat challenging to on one's own both concoct (out of thin air) a business case regarding a supposed need, lay out a workshop and learning plan, build the system according to the best of my abilities while still doing it (literally) by the book I am writing...and then to live to write about all of that!

Doing all of the parts means that I also get more or less "perfect information", which is never the case in real life. We never know all there is to know and how best to approach it.

So with that said, reality in a real production context will pose other problems than those I had when making this material for you. What is hard on one's own is stuff like having no one to really ideate with, no one to do another part of the labor, no one to help you role play business owner etc. Working with others, however, will give you a somewhat realer problem set, such as discussing, arguing, teaching and learning with others. Never forget that the social side is _big_ for us as tech people.

I feel happy about what I _have_ made though, and I hope at the end of it, that you feel the same!
