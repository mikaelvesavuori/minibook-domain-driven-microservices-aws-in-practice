# On design and DDD

## On Domain Driven Design

Domain Driven Design has grown in the 20-odd years it's been around to be a foundational part of modern software architecture and shaping the methodology with which many work in software. It seems to have been given an enormous upswing after the microservices pattern become more in vogue some 5-10 years ago.

For me, reading about Domain Driven Design—first through articles and then through the [blue book](https://www.domainlanguage.com/ddd/blue-book/) and [red book](https://kalele.io/books/)—made for an exciting summer some years back: It was really obvious (!) that we need to connect the "business" with the implementation. The explosive thing about the books, however, was that they went well and beyond the platitudes of the _statement_ (as you read it in the last sentence) to actually detailing patterns, strategies and ways to actually get there.

The "problem", if one can call it that, is that both of the books are big. Like really big. I think they fall squarely into the lap of certain types of folks who still enjoy the intellectual exercise and sometimes relatively abstract way of learning that goes with the territory.

## On design

As for me, who has did not graduate in Computer Science but has in some way worked with computers since I was a kid but, development is something that was learned on my own. While many years ago I might have understood what an architect did, I personally gradually learned more and more on that side as I started building my own software, distributing open source, and leading technical teams.

One side of the word "design" that I feel to be misunderstood is around how it relates to practices such as Agile and its various forms (which is something every company and context I've been at has talked about, but not really delivered on) as well as to how the architect(s) fit in within modern software development, the DevOps paradigm, and being generally allergic to upfront planning.

It's nice then to see that this is less a real issue than a perceived one. We can see this in how Agile framework co-founder Robert C. Martin tries to set the record straight in his [Clean Agile: Back to Basics](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-agile-back/9780135782002/) as well as in the humble "[connect the penthouse with the engine room](https://architectelevator.com)" metaphor stated by Gregor Hohpe. They both express that design is something that _must_ be done, Agile or not, and that modern circumstances do not have to pass on a golden key to some Ivory Tower dude to handle the design on their own.
