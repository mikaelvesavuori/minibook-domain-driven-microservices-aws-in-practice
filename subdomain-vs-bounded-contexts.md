# Subdomain vs bounded contexts

> One confusion that Evans sometimes notices in teams is differentiating between bounded contexts and subdomains. In an ideal world they coincide, but in reality they are often misaligned. He uses an example of a bank structured around cash accounts and credit cards. These two subdomains in the banking domain are also bounded contexts. After reorganising the business around business accounts and personal accounts, there are now two other subdomains, but the bounded contexts stay the same, which means they are now misaligned with the new subdomains. This often results in two teams having to work in the same bounded contexts with an increasing risk of ending up with a big ball of mud.
