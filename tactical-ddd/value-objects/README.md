# Value objects

What differentiates a _Value Object_ from an _Entity_ is that, _Value Objects_are immutable and do not have a unique identity, are defined only by the values of their attributes. The consequence of this immutability is that in order to update a _Value Object_, you must create a new instance to replace the old one.
