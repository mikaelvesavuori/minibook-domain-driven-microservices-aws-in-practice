# Tactical DDD

It's high time to put those "tactical" patterns in Domain Driven Design to work, breathing life into our domain model.

This section describes key passages of the code and the overall implementation rather than rehashing the _complete_ and rather extensive code base.

We will inspect and analyze some of the usage of all (TODO most?) of the tactical patterns:

* Modules
* Services
* Repositories
* Factories
* Value objects
* Entities
* Aggregates
* Events
