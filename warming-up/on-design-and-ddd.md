# On design

As for me, who didn't graduate in Computer Science—but have in some way or another worked with computers since I was a kid—development is something that was learned on my own. While many years ago I might have understood what an architect did, I personally gradually learned more and more on that side as I started building my own software, distributing open source, and leading technical teams.

I've since come to the opinion, or perhaps understanding, that somewhat universally, developers/engineers spend a lot less time on design than they seemingly should. Instead a combination of attitudes seem to be pervasive.

* "Let the architect do it", or
* "There's no time and/or budget for design", or
* "It's Agile, man, f\*\*k design, it's part of the code", or
* Any other derivative of the same attitude.

No, all my experiences are not aligned with this, but there is some persistent truth to the above in my professional career. It's more of a question of quantity of how apparent the attitude becomes rather than if the problem surfaces at all.
{% endhint %}

One side of the word "design" that I feel to be misunderstood is around how it relates to practices such as Agile and its various forms—which is something every company and context I've been at has talked about, but not really delivered on—as well as to how the architect role fits in within modern software development, the DevOps paradigm, and being generally allergic to upfront planning.

It's nice then to see that this is less a real issue (i.e. not being supported in the orthodox Agile mindset) than it is a perceived issue, perpetuated by misguided business analysts, project/product managers, engineers, and others. We can see this in how Agile framework co-founder Robert C. Martin tries to set the record straight in his [Clean Agile: Back to Basics](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-agile-back/9780135782002/) as well as in the humble "[connect the penthouse with the engine room](https://architectelevator.com)" metaphor stated by Gregor Hohpe. **They both express that **_**design**_** is something that must be done**, Agile or not, and that modern circumstances do not have to pass on a golden key to some Ivory Tower dude to handle the design on their own.

This is a huge topic to unpack, what with its layers of psychology, leadership, organization, engineering, and other sub-areas coming into play. Henceforth what I am interested is stating that **design is important and it's your job as an engineer to handle it**. How you get there is another problem I will not necessarily address.

## You have to design more to be better at it

Nothing has improved my own skills as much as setting up small projects with clear goals. Part of those goals should always be "What do I want to improve on, or learn?".

After having read this minibook, and maybe even trying to build the application on your own using the guidance here, take some time to reflect on what didn't make sense, what was hard, what you feel you can do better. Can the language improve? Can the abstractions be better handled? Can you be more expressive with relations between systems?

Reading is not the end goal—designing and reflecting on the results of the process is. And I'm not the only one adament in stating that domain-driven design is a solid foundation to build our design flow around, as well as informing how we practically develop our software as a team.
