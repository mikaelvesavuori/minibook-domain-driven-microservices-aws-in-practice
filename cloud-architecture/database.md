# Database

Our use case does not have a strict need for extensive relational mappings, so we can be broader in our selection.

The serverless database option on AWS is DynamoDB, a database that dates back to 2012 and which has gained additional features throughout the years.

It's the best choice we have available in AWS for serverless solutions using microservices and with out type of domain oriented services. Also, while there is AWS Aurora on the relational spectrum of things, there just does not exist really good relational solutions that are optimized for the cloud that checks all the needed boxes.
