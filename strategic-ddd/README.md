# ðŸ—º Strategic DDD

The "strategic" half of DDD deals as expected with those concerns that are more wide-ranging across the system, more fundamental to its functionality, closer to the business processes, and anything else that will drive the details and requirements for later implementation work.

In this part we will focus on:

* Documenting our **ubiquitous language** (terminology, naming...)
* Drawing out the boundaries of our contexts (systems or applications...)
* Defining the relations between contexts

This isn't technical work per se, but it dramatically eases the technical work we will do later.

It's as easy as "No strategic DDD = no DDD". Let's get to work!
